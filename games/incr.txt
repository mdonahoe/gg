# Concepts

1. SNAKE, but you are a general giving commands to thousands of snakes at once.
2. play a game inside it's own code. Be careful!
3. text-only game where you unlock new words and spells. Text-based NOITA? (Can you even have a "clicky game" without a mouse???)
4. What would STRANGE LOOP be as a game?
5. Give feedback to ChatGPT by clicking on it's words. It talks to you, and you give it reinforcement.
6. 2048, but with combining words into higher-level concepts, exploring the tech tree.
